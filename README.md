## About
---
A website with an Etch-A-Sketch board which user can draw on. Features include the ability to change dimensions of the board, color to draw with, an eraser tool, a clear tool and a special pen which can change colors and draw in the colors of the rainbow.

Live Website : https://fareeza05.github.io/etch-a-sketch/

## Features
---
* Interface the sketchboard, buttons, and a display below it which indicates whether or not user is in draw mode (toggled on and off by clicking anywhere on the screen)
* Buttons cause user's pen to change colors, and website features a dropdown color picker menu which submits hex input.
* Input field for dimension with a limit starting at 2x2 going up to 100x100.

## Future Improvements
---
* Refine the front end in order to make whole website look more cohesive, and to make user experience smoother.
* Add a 'darken/lighten' button which can allow user to use a pen which gradually changes opacity upon use.
* Add more displays and indicators, which tell user what color they are using
* Currently when user switches to rainbow or eraser button, they cannot switch back to using a solid color using the select color button. This is an issue which needs to be addressed in future updates of this website. 
* User experience has room to improve, it is still a bit difficult to draw while also toggling the draw mode on and off. Improvements should also be made to make this a smoother experience.
* More TBA...

This project has solidified a lot of my skills, and I have grown more confident in my Javascript skills. I have gathered a more thorough understanding of the DOM and event listeners, and learned about how to work with multiple types of input.
